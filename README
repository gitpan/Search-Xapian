Search::Xapian version 1.0.4.0
==============================

This is Search::Xapian, a Perl XS frontend to the Xapian C++ search library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

By default, Makefile.PL looks for xapian-config on your PATH.  You can specify
a path for xapian-config by passing XAPIAN_CONFIG=/path/to/xapian-config on
the command line after Makefile.PL.  You can also specify a C++ compiler by
passing CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ after Makefile.PL.

For compatibility with Search::Xapian 1.0.3.0 and early, XAPIAN_CONFIG and
CXX can also be specified as environmental variables, but specifying them on
the command line is preferable because it means that they will automatically
be preserved if Makefile.PL is modified and gets rerun automatically by
the generated Makefile.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  The Xapian C++ search library, which can be downloaded by following
