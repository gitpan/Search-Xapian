Search::Xapian version 1.0.5.0
==============================

This is Search::Xapian, a Perl XS frontend to the Xapian C++ search library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

By default, Makefile.PL looks for xapian-config on your PATH.  You can specify
a path for xapian-config by passing XAPIAN_CONFIG=/path/to/xapian-config on
the command line after Makefile.PL.  You can also specify a C++ compiler by
passing CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ after Makefile.PL.  These values are stored
in the generated Makefile and will be used if "make" causes "perl Makefile.PL"
to be automatically rerun (e.g. if you modify Makefile.PL).

(For compatibility with Search::Xapian 1.0.3.0 and early, XAPIAN_CONFIG and
CXX can also be specified as environmental variables.  Specifying them on the
command line is preferred because it avoids issues with differing syntax
between shells and having to export variables).
