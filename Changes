Revision history for Perl extension Search::Xapian.

0.8.0.0  Tue May  4 16:06:41 2004
	- New version numbering scheme chases xapian version
	- Added overloaded function for TermIterator class	
	- Wrapped all methods for Xapian::Enquire (except 
	  set_weighting_scheme, which is passed a Weight object - a
	  class for which wrappers do not yet exist).
	- Replaced AUTOLOAD method designed to reduce code redundancy
	  in Enquire.pm with two separate methods (it was preventing
	  attempts to call unwrapped methods from throwing errors).
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Converted to use xapian.h and Xapian:: classnames
	- add_term is the new preferred name for add_term_nopos
	- Added stubs for PostingIterator and PositionIterator
	- String values are now passed in a zero-byte safe way
	- OM_DB_* renamed to Search::Xapian::DB_*
	- Now requires Xapian at least version 0.8.0
	- Search::Xapian::Database::allterms_end() fixed (was returning
	  the same as Search::Xapian::Database::allterms_begin()
