Revision history for Perl extension Search::Xapian.

0.9.6.0  Sun Jun 04 01:14:00 2006
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Alex's CPAN email address bounces, so change occurences of it
	  to direct users to the xapian-discuss mailing list for now.
	- Correct several occurrences of "Xapian::Search::" to
	  "Search::Xapian::".
	- Wrap Enquire::set_docid_order (and document set_sort_forward
	  as deprecated.)
	- Wrap new method Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance_then_value.
	- Document Enquire::set_sort_by_* (and document set_sorting as
	  deprecated.)
	- Wrap the BM25Weight constructor which takes parameters
	  (the default one is much less useful, since Xapian defaults
	  to BM25Weight with the default parameters anyway!)
	- Wrap Enquire::set_sort_by_value_then_relevance()
	- Wrap the optional flags parameter to QueryParser::parse_query().
	- Disable the wrappers for the transaction API to WritableDatabase
	  - it's not implemented by any database backend yet, so it's not
	  useful to wrap it at present.
	- Fix PostingIterator != and == to handle both other PostingIterators
	  and numbers like PositionIterator does.
	- Wrap constants FLAG_BOOLEAN_ANY_CASE and FLAG_WILDCARD.
	- Fix typos and other problems in the POD documentation.  Document all
	  constants.
	- Update the list of unwrapped classes and methods.
	- Update the version in the README file.  Add code to Makefile.PL
	  to check that the various references to the current version are
	  all up-to-date.
	- Makefile.PL now refuses to proceed if it can't find Xapian.
	- Makefile.PL now checks that the Xapian version and Search::Xapian
	  version match, and if not issues a non-fatal warning (for now).
	- Makefile.PL now allows building against an uninstalled xapian-core
	  tree (which is useful when doing development work on Search::Xapian
	  itself).
	- Add feature test for Document::termlist_begin().
	[Changes contributed by Tim Brody]
	- Add MANIFEST.SKIP to allow "make manifest".

0.9.2.4  Fri Feb 15 14:59:23 2006
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts and Tim Brody]
	- Catch C++ exceptions from QueryParser and rethrow them as Perl
	  exceptions.
	- Makefile.PL now checks environmental variable CXX for the C++
	  compiler to use.
	- Fixed cross-wired methods inside Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin
	  and Enquire::get_matching_terms_end (thanks to Arne Georg Gleditsch
	  for reporting this).
	- $q = Query(op, @termlist) now handles terms with embedded zero bytes.
	- Removed Query::clone() and = overload - they would die if ever used
	  and aren't useful since a Query object is essentially immutable once
	  constructed.
	- Removed MSet::max_size - C++ only has it so MSet works as an STL
	  container.
	- RSet::size() returns doccount not termcount (though they're currently
	  the same type underneath so this is an aesthetic internal change).
	- Wrap most of the changed Xapian::QueryParser API.
	- Wrap new SimpleStopper class (with test cases).
	- Added PerlStopper class which can be subclassed in Perl to implement
	  your own stop word algorithm.
	- Wrap new Enquire sorting API methods.
	- Updated list of unwrapped classes and methods in documentation.
	- Make != and == work for comparing iterators (as well as ne and eq).

	- Corrected module names advertised in the POD.
	- Added new_term method to Search:Xapian::Query.
	- Fixed the package statement in BoolWeight.pm.
	- Removed useless prototypes in Search::Xapian::Query.
	- some extraneous blank lines removed (from >1 lines to just 1 line)

	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Fixed handling of optional parameters in Document::add_posting(),
	  Document::add_term(), Document::remove_posting(),
	  Enquire::set_cutoff(), Enquire::set_sorting(), and
	  QueryParser::set_stemming_options().  Added test cases for
	  the first three.
	- Fixed wrapping of Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin() and
	  get_matching_terms_end().
	- Wrap versions of RSet::add_document(), RSet::remove_document(), and

	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Fixed exporting of DB_* constants.

	- Fixed MSet::convert_to_percent() to actually return a value!
	- Wrap missing MSetIterator methods: --, get_collapse_count().
	- Removed bogus += methods from all iterators (these actually ignored
	  the second argument and always incremented once).
	- Cleaned up wrapping of ++ methods for all iterators.
	- Wrap missing ESet methods: back().
	- Fixed wrapping of ESetIterator methods: ==, !=.
	- Wrap 3 argument form of Enquire::set_sorting().

	  omitted.
	- Wrap ValueIterator class.
	- Added tests of many of the new and fixed methods.
	- Documentation now lists unwrapped classes and methods.
